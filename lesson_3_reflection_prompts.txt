When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  There are a lot of reasons, really.  One would be that you are working with a group
  and everyone needs access to the updated files at all times (and the ability to 
  share their changes).  Another reason would be that you make changes on multiple
  computers, or need the option to easily continue a project on a new computer.  Also, 
  the remote repository is a good backup if something breaks with your local repository.
