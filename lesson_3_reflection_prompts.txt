When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	There are a lot of reasons, really.  One would be that you are working with a group
  	and everyone needs access to the updated files at all times (and the ability to 
  	share their changes).  Another reason would be that you make changes on multiple
  	computers, or need the option to easily continue a project on a new computer.  Also, 
  	the remote repository is a good backup if something breaks with your local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I like that you have control over what goes in to either repo, remote or local.  If
	Git did it automatically, it may happen at a time when you aren't ready to have the
	changes in the remote added.  I can't really think of many examples where this would
	be the case, just from lack of experience, but I do know that erring on the side of
	caution is most likely the best route for these situations.  Ultimately, I am in 
	control of my files and my repos, not Git, and that's how I'd want it.
